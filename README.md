# nyc-age-populations

The map (once I get my data wrangled) will show the NYC population of different age ranges from 2014-2019. A UI drop down will allow users to choose what age range they want to view, and a UI slider will let them move through different years.

At the moment, I am using a template from a previous module as the web page, but I plan to choose a different template once I get the data and map figured out.
